# Project Title: Luminus

**Who has never let a plant die because he forgot to water it?**

The Luminus project consists to create a program that allows the leds to react according to the music.Then, it can let the user choose and create light programs (like color gradients) on a user interface. And finnaly, we want to add a feature to track the moisture quality of a plant.

So, now you can have a bright musical atmosphere, but also a reminder to water your plants
