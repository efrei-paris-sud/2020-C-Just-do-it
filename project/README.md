# LUMINUS:


**Description:**  

*Problem Definition :

When you turn on the light at home, it is pleasant to choose the color according to the atmosphere in which a user is. We have all lost a remote in our life, so using a site on your phone to choose the color of your light is the solution. The led strip does not lightly light up in a solid color, we can put gradients on it. Finally, when a user organizes an event at home, he can decide that his light atmosphere (the leds) react to the music he is listening to.

*Challenges & Motivation

After carrying out the lab on RGB leds which was very interesting, we decided to continue working on arduino light. Indeed, the aesthetic and practical aspect of the LEDs that we can use on a daily basis pleased us both.
We wanted to do something useful, that we liked and that would allow us to learn how to use an esp32, and sound sensors.
