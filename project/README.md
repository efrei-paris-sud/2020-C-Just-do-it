# LUMINUS:


**Description:**  

When you turn on the light at home, it is pleasant to choose the color according to the atmosphere in which a user is. We have all lost a remote in our life, so using a site on your phone to choose the color of your light is the solution. The led strip does not lightly light up in a solid color, we can put gradients on it. Finally, when a user organizes an event at home, he can decide that his light atmosphere (the leds) react to the music he is listening to.
