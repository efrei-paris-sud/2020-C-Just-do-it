# Project Description


**First Step :**

During this project session we had a problem with the leds we had purchased. Indeed, they no longer worked, and our sound sensor and our intensity sensor have not yet been delivered.
So, we decided to start our project with the most difficult part, i.e. successfully connecting our ESP32 to a web.
