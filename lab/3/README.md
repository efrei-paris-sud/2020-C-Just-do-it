The Lab was about how to use I2C LCD with using will use Oled library.
In this lab we learned:

**STEP 1:** Importing Library:
In this step, we just followed the instructions.

**STEP 2** :
In this step, we connecte the Oled Display using our last schematic of the lab 2 ( Arduino and OLED ).

**STEP 3 :FIND I2C devices.**
- [Exercise 1](Ex1)


**STEP 4: Display shapes and bitmaps**
- [Exercise 2](Ex2)

**STEP 5: Display a custom image**
  - [Exercise 3](Ex3)
