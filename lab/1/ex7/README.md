In this exercise we have write a function **setColor(int red,int green, int blue)** and **analogWrite(color_pin,color_value)** for each color (i.e., for red one analogWrite(red_pin,red)) and we called setColor(r,g,b) in our loop.
We repared a program to have different colors (at least 5) with a delay of 1000 ms .
