# Exercise 3 ( Lesson 6 ) 

In this exercise, we used **push buttons** to connect two points in a circuit . 
We used : pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); in setup.
To read the digital signal you can use buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); 
And finally we used a if :  if (buttonState == HIGH){....}else{....}.
