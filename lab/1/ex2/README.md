# Exercise 2 
In this LAB, we used Arduino IDE, for helping us we use the site : Arduino Language Reference.
In this exercise we need to turn on and off an LED in port 4.

We have learned how to program with arduino using the **setup()function** which is called when a program starts and initializes and sets the initial values. 
Then, the **loop()** function loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. 
For writing a digital value we used **digitalWrite (port_number, LOW or HIGH)**. And we have setup the port_number as OUTPUT by using **pinMode(port_number, OUTPUT);** in the setup function.
