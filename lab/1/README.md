# Lab 1
The Lab was about learning how to work with sensors and actuators.

In this lab we learned:

**- Micro-Contoller**
**- Digital Signal and how to Read/Write in a Micro Controller**
**- Digital Signal and how to Read/Write in a Micro Controller**
**- Digital Signal and how to Read/Write in a Micro Controller**
**- Analog Signal and how to Read/Write in a Micro Controller**
**- PWM**
**- LED**
**- Arduino**
**- Arduino IDE**
**- Extra: Relay**
**- Extra: Fritzing**
  
The goal is to learn how to use arduino software, know how to use the available materials and understand how to create circuits with different elements.
