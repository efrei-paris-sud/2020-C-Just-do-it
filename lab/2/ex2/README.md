# Exercise 2 

To understand the exercise, we need to understand what is an **Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C)** : it is a communications protocol common in microcontroller-based systems.
So it requires only two wires: Serial Data Line (SDA) and Serial Clock Line (SCL). 
The question was to specify the I2C pins (SDA and SCL) in our devices such as microcontroller, sensors, actuators.

## Issues

So we referred to the **Arduino-Uno-Pin-Diagram.png** image in the github to see that the SDA and SCL are in the lower right corner in grey.
