# Exercise 2 

To understand the exercise, we need to understand what is an **Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C)** : it is a communications protocol common in microcontroller-based systems.
So it requires only two wires: Serial Data Line (SDA) and Serial Clock Line (SCL). 
The question was to specify the I2C pins (SDA and SCL) in our devices such as microcontroller, sensors, actuators.

into this schema, the I2C pins (SDA and SCL) are A4 and A5 (bottom left)


## Issues

So we referred to the **Arduino-Uno-Pin-Diagram.png** image in the github to see that the SDA and SCL are in the lower right corner in grey.
